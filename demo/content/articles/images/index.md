Use images in your markdown and they will be made responsive. Just refer to them
by their filepath relative to the markdown document. For example if you have a
directory called `images` in the same directory as your main markdown file you
can display an image like this:

```
![An example](images/example.png)
```

![An example](images/1200x800.png)
